Possible imperfections or improvements would include:

High cardinality in Dimension like Customer or Product, seperate fact tables for subsets could improve the Performance

The fact table is generaly very wide, since it stores many fields it could slow down the ETL processes.

Since some dimensions are normalized (e.g., ProductSubCategory and ProductTopCategory) the query Performance could suffer due to additional joins

How could These be improved?
We could flatten the Dimensions by combining Product, ProductSubCategory, and ProductTopCategory.

Further, we could Partition the Fact tables to e.g. a Fact_InternetSales_Domestic for domestic customers and Fact_InternetSales_International for international customers.


To address the wideness we could: 

Remove derived fields (e.g., OrderLineProfit, OrderLineTaxAmount) from the fact table.

Or

Develop summary fact tables that store pre-calculated aggregates (e.g., monthly revenue by region).
